gEconCpp
====================

These are the C++ source files of the
R-package [gEcon](http://gecon.r-forge.r-project.org/). The functions
therein are used to parse / evaluate / reduce the CGE/DSGE models
stated in the `.gcn` files and output them in R format.

This repository here is only for (my) educational purposes, for the
"true" functionality, go check out the **gEcon** package.
